# Summary
To render anything on the screen we need some space so in order to define that space we also need to define a unit of that measurement. There are different types of units like `px`, `rems`, `ems`, `percentages` etc.

This RFC discusses about why and what units we will be using in our design system.

# Basic Example
Some examples of where and how units are used
```css
button {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 16px;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 2px;
  height: 48px;
  width: 200px;
}
```
```css
button {
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  margin: 0.125rem;
  height: 3rem;
  width: 12.5rem;
}
```

# Motivation
### Why are we doing this?
As our applications will be used by our users on different platforms(web, mobile, native apps), different screens with different pixel densities and different screens sizes we need to make sure the content is accessible and the layout is consistent in different scenarios.

Units are one of the core foundation principle and building block that will define how our overall designs i.e components, layouts shall be designed as we progress so that we can make our apps work on different platforms, different screen sizes and different pixel densities.

### What use cases does it support?
It'll define what units we'll be using for different styling properties in our design system. Below are the categories to which units will be applied
1. Typography - font-size, line-height
2. Layout - padding, margin, width, height

### What is the expected outcome?
We shall be able to answer following questions as a conclusion to this RFC
1. What unit we'll be using for typography and layouts?
2. How will we ensure accessibility in terms of readability and layout both?
3. How will we use platform dependent units(px, rem, dp etc) in order to render the components on a particular platform in a generic way without polluting our design system components.
4. How/where we will store the unit as design tokens?

# Detailed Design
For anything to be rendered on the screen it needs to have a space on the screen and that space needs to have a measurable unit for the rendering engine to understand how to organise things on the screen.

The styling properties that require units are:
1. Typography
   * `font-size`
   * `line-height`
2. Layout
   1. Space
      * `padding` - top, right, bottom, left
      * `margin` - top, right, bottom, left
   2. Size
      * `height` - height, min-height, max-height
      * `width` - width, min-width, max-width

## Checklist
To choose which unit will work best for us we can use the below checklist:
1. Whether the content is accessible when the user changes the default font size of the browser.
2. Whether the content is accessible when the user zooms in/out on the browser.
3. Whether the interface is able to render on different screen sizes, pixel densities etc.

## Different units:
### `px`
* The most commonly used unit is `px` i.e pixels.
* It works on both web and iOS/android apps.
* `px` defines an absolute value for typography and layout, which means anything that has px as a unit will be rendered same at all the screen sizes, resolutions, pixel densities. For example, `padding: 16px` will be `16px` regardless of the screen resolution/platform `1680x1050`, `1024x640` or `360x640`.
### `rem`
* `rem` is a relative css unit which works in relative to the users device settings and screen resolutions.
* It works on web but **not** on iOS/android.

Eg-1: `font-size: 1rem` - It will be rendered as 16px by default. If the user changes their default browser font-size to 14 then it'll be rendered as 14px.

Eg-2: `padding: 1rem` - the padding will be calculated as 16px by defualt. If the user changes the default brwoser font-size to 14 then the padding will be calculated as 14px.

> üìù Note: 1 rem = 16px default in all the browsers unless the default font-size of the browser is set to anything else explicitly.

See below how browser devtools show `px` equivalent to `rem`
![Rem in devtools as computed styles](./images/unit-font-size-rem.png)

### `dp`
* density independent pixels
**WIP**

## Deep Dive
Until now we have understood few basic things. Now let's deep dive and see how this actually matters when things get rendered on screen. I've created an [interactive POC](https://codesandbox.io/s/scaling-test-szi8i) that you can play around with. I'll be using the same to demonstrate few things in this section.

I've created 4 buttons which have same css properties but the units are different.
![Scaling POC](./images/unit-output.png)
### layout rem, text rem <!-- omit in TOC -->
* This button has all the layout and typography properties defined in `rem`. Here's how the css looks like
   ```css
   .Button1 {
   background: #3987f0;
   border: 1px solid #3987f0;
   box-sizing: border-box;
   border-radius: 2px;
   
   margin-bottom: 16px;
   padding-left: 1.5rem; /* 24px */
   padding-right: 1.5rem; /* 24px */
   padding-top: 0.75rem; /* 12px */
   padding-bottom: 0.75rem; /* 12px */
   height: 3rem; /* 48px */
   }
   .Button1 > div {
   color: white;
   font-size: 1rem;
   }
   ```
* Now if we increase the browser font size **everything** will **increase relatively** to the browser font size. [Try it out here](https://codesandbox.io/s/scaling-test-szi8i)
### layout rem, text px <!-- omit in TOC -->
* This button has all the layout properties defined in `rem` but typography in `px`. Here's how the css looks like
   ```css
   .Button2 {
   background: #3987f0;
   border: 1px solid #3987f0;
   box-sizing: border-box;
   border-radius: 2px;
   
   margin-bottom: 16px;
   height: 3rem; /* 48px */
   padding-left: 1.5rem; /* 24px */
   padding-right: 1.5rem; /* 24px */
   padding-top: 0.75rem; /* 12px */
   padding-bottom: 0.75rem; /* 12px */
   }
   .Button2 > div {
   color: white;
   font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```
* Now if we increase the browser font size the **layout properties** will **increase relatively** but the **typography** will remain **unchanged** as it is using absolute unit i.e `16px`. [Try it out here](https://codesandbox.io/s/scaling-test-szi8i)
### layout px, text rem <!-- omit in TOC -->
* This button has all the layout properties defined in `px` but typography in `rem`. Here's how the css looks like
   ```css
   .Button3 {
   background: #3987f0;
   border: 1px solid #3987f0;
   box-sizing: border-box;
   border-radius: 2px;
   
   margin-bottom: 16px;
   height: 48px;
   padding: 16px;
   }
   .Button3 > div {
   color: white;
   font-size: 1rem;
   }
   ```
* Now if we increase the browser font size the **layout properties** will remain **unchanged** but the **typography** will **increase relatively**. [Try it out here](https://codesandbox.io/s/scaling-test-szi8i)
### layout px, text px <!-- omit in TOC -->
* This button has all the layout and typography properties defined in `px`. Here's how the css looks like
   ```css
   .Button4 {
   margin-bottom: 16px;
   height: 48px;
   background: #3987f0;
   border: 1px solid #3987f0;
   box-sizing: border-box;
   border-radius: 2px;
   
   margin-bottom: 16px;
   height: 48px;
   padding: 16px;
   }
   .Button4 > div {
   color: white;
   font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```
* Now if we increase the browser font size **everything** will remain **unchanged** to the browser font size since everything is in absolute units. [Try it out here](https://codesandbox.io/s/scaling-test-szi8i)

Now let's see how things look when we increase the browsers default font size
![Layout and typography at increased font size](./images/unit-font-size-increased.png)

Now let's see how things look when we zoom to 200% in the browser
![Layout and typography at 200% zoom](./images/unit-zoom.png)

> üìù Note: The page zoom and font size change don't mimic each other. Hence things at x font size are not same as y% zoom. 

## Absolute unit vs relative unit?
Until now we saw how typography and layout reacts to font sizes and zoom with different units. Referring to [our checklist](#checklist) gives us 3 options:
1. **Everything px**
   1. Changing default font-size on the browser level doesn't changes the text content size.
   2. Changing default font-size on the browser level doesn't changes the layout sizes. Nothing breaks as everything is in absolute unit.
   3. Page zoom works as expected and the layout never breaks.
   4. Image when font-size is `32px`
   ![Layout px text px](./images/unit-layout-px-text-px.png)
2. **Everything rems**
   1. Changing default font-size changes the font size of the content.
   2. Changing default font-size changes layout sizes relatively. Things mostly doesn't break as everything is in ratios.
   3. Page zoom works as expected and the layout mostly doesn't breaks.
   4. Image when font-size is `32px`
   ![Layout rem text rem](./images/unit-layout-rem-text-rem.png)
3. **Typography rems and Layout px**
   1. Changing default font-size changes the font size of the content.
   2. Changing default font-size changes doesn't changes the layout sizes. Some layout breakages can happen as the text may end up being bigger than you expect in your layout.
   3. Page zoom works but sometimes breaks certain things.
   4. Image when font-size is `32px`
   ![Layout px text rem](./images/unit-layout-px-text-rem.png)

### Absolute unit vs relative unit matrix
| Unit                      | content size changes? | layout size changes? | layout breakages? | page zoom works? |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: | :--------------: |
| Everything px             |           ‚ùå           |          ‚ùå           |         ‚ùå         |        ‚úÖ         |
| Everything rems           |           ‚úÖ           |          ‚úÖ           |         ‚ùå         |        ‚úÖ         |
| Tyography rems, layout px |           ‚úÖ           |          ‚ùå           |         ‚úÖ         |        ‚úÖ         |

### Accessibility Guideline?
The WCAG guideline says that content satisfies the success criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%. It can go beyond that but logically beyond that the scaling becomes more extreme and adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems.

For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them, causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line, causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult to read.

### What will work for us?
Looking at the POC and the [matrix](#absolute-unit-vs-relative-unit-matrix), we shall definitely go for relative units. It has more pros than cons. Usability and readability is something we shouldn't trade off.
## How will we store it?
storing unitless scale values in tokens?
store in px and render in rems?
Global Reset to make it work for our use case i.e base = 14px
html {
  font-size: 100% // i.e 16px
  font-size: 87.5% // i.e 14px
}

# Drawbacks/Constraints
Why should we *not* do this? Maybe try to consider the following constraints
- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity.
- The impact of it on new as well as existing consumer projects.
- Cost of migration.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives
What other designs/patterns/strategies have been considered?

# Adoption strategy
If we implement this proposal, how will existing consumer projects adopt it? 
- Is this a breaking change? 
- Can we write a codemod?
- How do we prioritise this with business and product folks?
- How do we communicate with other teams? Will updating docs suffice or do we need a dedicated interaction with them?

# How do we educate people?
- How should this be taught to other folks?
- What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? 
- How is this idea best presented?
- Not required since tokens are abstractions

# Open Questions
1. Browser zoom and browser font size behave differently? Couldn't figure out what does browser zoom does differently like what css props does it changes so in order to have parity we need to mimic it? Asking since the POC I shared and the most systems they either work well with browser zoom or browser font size change but rarely both.
![Browser font size change](./images/unit-browser-font-size.jpeg)
![Browser zoom](./images/unit-browser-zoom.jpeg)
2. Rems only for typography or even for spacings(padding, margins etc)? IMO, both since if one is absolute and other one is relative then the layout will break? Like text in rem and padding/height in px might lead to break text if you increase browser font size?
3. Building the vocabulary in the team? rems are hard to visualise? Maybe store in px and render in rems.
4. Design tokens for cross platforms(react for web, react native for apps) which means the typography and spacing scale needs to be stored in a unitless fashion?
5. Couldn't find what does WCAG says about this exactly? For eg: it just says the content should be readable at 200% zoom - put the link to wcag guideline
6. React Native equivalent for rem?

Common Questions:
Do we need rems in typography?
Do we need rems in spacing?
Do we need spacing and sizing? or just spacing will do the job?
What happens with everything rems
what happens with everything px
what happens with font size rems and rest everything px
How do we store it in tokens? Store in px and render in dependent platform units?
React Native is still gray area. What are rems equivalent in RN?
